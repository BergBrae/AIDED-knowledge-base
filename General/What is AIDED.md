NASA's University Student Research Challenge (USRC) project usally run for a year, but the team was not finished. Thankfully, we applied for a one year extension and were approved. The idea of having drones ride busses was a big undertaking, and NASA understood that. Many of the USRC prgrams are out there/difficult, and many end their projects with minimum proof of concept or minimal work. However, the AIDED team knew that demonstrating a successfull trip with a bus was what was considered a sucessful conclusion to the project. Our NASA representatives granted the extension and aknowledged our hard work.

As for the software team, the memebers writing this knowledge base joined around or arfter spring of 2022, a year into the project. All progrees made before that point was not documented or saved, and therefore not in our final solution.
